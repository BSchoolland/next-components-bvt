# Modal Dialog Documentation
This document provides an overview and usage guide for the Modal Dialog component implemented in React for Next.js. Modal dialogs are popups that interrupt user flow and provide information and/or request input.

## Overview
The Modal Dialog component consists of a wrapper component that conditionally renders a modal dialog based on the `isOpen` prop. The modal dialog accepts a `children` prop that can be used to render the content of the modal. It also accepts full style customization, or several pre-built styles.

## Use cases
Some examples of use cases for this component include:
- login forms
- sign up forms
- profile editing forms
- "are you sure?" confirmation dialogs
- More forceful cookie consent dialogs
